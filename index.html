    <h1>Scratch embeds in Discord</h1>
    <p>
      Did you ever wish you could share your Scratch projects a way a bit more aesthetic on Discord ?<br>
      Now, you can !
    </p>
    <p>
      You are maybe going to ask me : "Cool, but how do I use this ?".
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very simple : take your Scratch project's url : <code>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/XXXXXXX</code>.
      Just copy the number you have instead of the Xs : this is your project's ID. Then, just share this link into Discord, and replace the Xs by it : `https://zpiboo.github.io/scratchembeds?id=XXXXXXX`.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that's it !
      Hope you enjoy.
