# Scratch embeds in Discord
Did you ever wish you could share your Scratch projects a way a bit more aesthetic on Discord ?
Now, you can !

You are maybe going to ask me : "Cool, but how do I use this ?".

It is very simple : take your Scratch project's url : `https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/XXXXXXX`.
Just copy the number you have instead of the Xs : this is your project's ID. Then, just share this link into Discord, and replace the Xs by it : `https://zpiboo.github.io/scratchembeds?id=XXXXXXX`.

Yes, that's it !
Hope you enjoy.
